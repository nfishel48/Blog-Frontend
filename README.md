> This website you're looking at was built using Vue.js Nuxt.js 
built on a modern web development architecture, the Jamstack.
Dynamic functionalities are handled by JavaScript. There is no 
restriction on which framework or library you must use. Server 
side operations are abstracted into reusable APIs and accessed 
over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be third party services 
or your custom function. Websites are served as static HTML 
files. These can be generated from source files, such as Markdown, 
using a Static Site Generator.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
