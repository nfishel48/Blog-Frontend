           10 Reasons to not use a Website builder and go with a custom solution 
        </h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">
        Website builders have become widely used in the last few years, 
        by a website builder I mean Wix, Square Space, Weebly. These types of sites do have some benefits. 
        They are cheap and can be set up quickly but a user with no coding knowledge. However, in this article I will give 10 reasons that if possible, 
        you should look into a more custom solution.
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Websites built with website builder tend to be extremely slow. Why does it matter how fast your site is? 
                <a href="/article3" style="color:orange">Click here to read my previous blog article on why site speed matters here.</a>
            </li>
            <li>Website builders often give you an unprofessional domain. When you tell your customers your URL you want it to be simple and professional. What sounds better on your business card? Yourbussinessname.com or yourbussinessname.adversistement.com. Some of these builders will let you use a custom domain but
                charge you premium to purchase and if you ever want to leave the site, they can hold your domain hostage.
            </li>
            <li>Website builders typical have Limited Trials and Paid features. Some website builders will let you build your site and post it for free but then want money later on, combine this with my previous point on the domain and they can lock down your business and essentially hold your website for ransom. Even if you can post your site for free some features may for pay only. 
                Something as simple as access to FTP could be blocked id you refuse to pay a fee.
            </li>
            <li>Data is an invaluable asset to all business no matter the size. When using a website builder your options to access your data can be limited.  
                Maybe if they are feeling charitable you will get access to analytics data, but you will never have full access to your database and be able to 
                run queries on the data collected form your own users.
            </li>
            <li>
                Limited Bandwidth will become a problem if your website or business really take off. What seemed like a great free option when you had a few users can become bottle neck stopping you from making untold amounts of money from new users. With custom solution your website can be deployed on a cloud server that will automatically expand as your business does.
            </li>
            <li>
                Websites built with website builders are often more susceptible to hackers. The only thing worse than not having a website at all is a defaced website that could be spreading hate messages or such under the name of your business.
            </li>
            <li>
                These types of websites can cause a lack of credibility with your users. A bland template looking site can drive away a user from choosing your business over a competitor
            </li>
            <li>
                You can’t run advertisements and make money on site like these. Some websites make thousands of dollars from running ads from networks like google AdSense. Using a website builder takes away your ability to do this.
            </li>
            <li>
                52.2% of web traffic is from mobile devices. Website builders often underperform on mobile. Some designs do not work for mobile devices and the High overhead of the website builder can impact performance on mobile.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most website builder companies do not keep backups of your site. Your hard work and entire online presence could be wiped out with one power outage at a data center. Even if it’s not on accident in the terms of service these companies have the right to shut down at any time and then you have no website.
            </li>
        </ol>
