         Have you ever spent hours waiting for a SQL query to finish running? 
         Google has a solution for this. Google BigQuery is a data warehousing 
         tool that enables scalable, cost-effective and fast analysis over petabytes 
         of data. BigQuery is typically accessed via Google cloud console however 
         it has client libraries for popular languages such as Java, .NET, Python so 
         it can be used in combination with other data analysis tools like Hadoop and 
         Pandas. BigQuery can be used for real time analysis of massive data sets and I 
         believe it will only become more useful as we move into the era of Big Data
