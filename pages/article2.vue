           Why you should be using Django for your next web project
        </h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">
        Finding the right tools for a project can sometimes be harder than the actual project itself.
        In this blog post I will discuss Django, a tool that I think everyone should try for their next web-based project.
        Django is a powerful web development framework for the Python programming language.
        Python itself ranges from first to third in rankings of popular programming languages depending on where you look. 
        This means near limitless free support in the form of Stack overflow posts and prewritten libraries. 
        </h2>
        <h2 class="subtitle">
         Djangoâ€™s motto is the web framework for perfectionists with deadlines. After you finish reading this post I hope that you will understand why that is a perfect description. 
         Instagram, Dropbox, Pinterest, Spotify, and Udemy are just a few major companies that are using Django as part of their tech stack. 
         The reasons that Django is so useful are its fast, its secure, its saleable, and its versatile.
        </h2>
        <h2 class="subtitle">
         Django has been designed with development speed in mind. Django helps developers turn ideas into projects and get projects finished and released. 
         Since Django is a Python framework all the benefits of python such as ease of use, code readability, and speed to write help speed up Django project development time.
        </h2>
        <h2 class="subtitle">
         Django is an open source project and thus the security of the framework is improved. 
         Django has built in process to stop developers from making mistakes that could make sites vulnerable to SQL injections, 
         Cross site scripting, clickjacking, as well as many other attacks. Django provides built in ways to handle authentication of
         users speeding up development time and making accounts more secure.
        </h2>
        <h2 class="subtitle">
        Django can handle lots of traffic. Instagram scaled to 100 million users using the Django framework on their backend. 
        Django can quickly and easily scale so you are not worried about your site going down when you are gaining users.
        </h2>
        <h2 class="subtitle">
       Django has been used in a variety of different applications. Content management systems, ecommerce, scientific computing. All these have Django applications written for them. Since Django is written in Python other python libraries can be used. 
       Popular libraries like TensorFlow, Pandas, Pillow, Numpy, or Beautiful Soup just to name a few.
